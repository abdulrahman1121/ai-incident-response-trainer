# Development Prompts - EdgeIncidentDrill Project

This document contains the prompts I used with an AI assistant to help build the AI-Powered Incident Response Training Platform.

## Initial Project Request

**Prompt 1:**
```
I need help building a unique project for Cloudflare. The requirements are: LLM (Llama 3.3 on Workers AI), Workflow/coordination (Workflows, Workers or Durable Objects), User input via chat or voice (Pages or Realtime), Memory or state. Can you help me plan this out and break it into steps? Also help me set up git and commit professionally after each step.
```

## Development Iterations

**Prompt 2:**
```
There are errors in voiceService.ts, can you help me fix them? Also, I'm new to Cloudflare and LLMs, can you create documentation that explains the basics so I can understand what we built?
```


**Prompt 3:**
```
The chat page is showing empty. Can you help me debug this?
```

**Prompt 4:**
```
There's a timestamp error in the chat: "msg.timestamp.toLocaleTimeString is not a function". Can you help me fix this?
```

**Prompt 5:**
```
The same timestamp error is still happening. Can you help me resolve this?
```

**Prompt 6:**
```
The training flow isn't working properly - it says "no active training" even after starting from scenarios. Can you help me fix the navigation?
```

**Prompt 7:**
```
The dashboard isn't updating after completing training sessions. Can you help me fix the data persistence?
```

**Prompt 8:**
```
Can you help me update the documentation to reflect the completed version and push to remote?
```

**Prompt 9:**
```
The guide file should stay local (it's in gitignore), right?
```

**Prompt 10:**
```
The README needs better instructions for users. Can you help me make it clearer and more beginner-friendly?
```

**Prompt 11:**
```
I need to add session timeout (5 mins) and fix the input methods. Users should be able to type answers and use voice input. Can you help me implement these features?
```

**Prompt 13:**
```
The dashboard is throwing a date error: "b.completedAt.getTime is not a function". Can you help me fix this?
```

**Promot 14:**
```
The readme needs to be updated, help me explain usage and guide others to be ablt to run it.
